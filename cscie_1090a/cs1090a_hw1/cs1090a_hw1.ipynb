    "1. Fetching HTML from screenboston.com (10 pts)\n",
    "2. Parsing HTML into structured data (15 pts)\n",
    "3. Augmenting data with historical snapshots (15 pts)\n",
    "4. Creating and manipulating a Pandas DataFrame (15 pts)\n",
    "5. Initial exploratory data analysis and visualization (15 pts)\n",
    "6. Finding Wikipedia pages for each screened film (7 pts)\n",
    "7. Storing Wikipedia HTML in the DataFrame (3 pts)\n",
    "8. Extracting and analyzing data from Wikipedia pages (15 pts)\n",
    "9. Wrap-up (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through these steps, you'll be transforming raw web data into a rich dataset ready for analysis. By the end, you'll have created a comprehensive overview of Boston's movie screening landscape, potentially uncovering interesting trends and patterns in the process. "

    "- Plots should be legible and interpretable *without having to refer to the code that generated them*. They should include labels for the $x$- and $y$-axes as well as a descriptive title and/or legend when appropriate.\n",
    "- When asked to interpret a visualization, do not simply describe it (e.g., \"the curve has a steep slope up\"), but instead explain what you believe the plot *means*.\n",
    "- Autograding tests are mostly to help you debug. The tests are not exhaustive so simply passing all tests may not be sufficient for full credit.\n",
    "- The use of *extremely* inefficient or error-prone code (e.g., copy-pasting nearly identical commands rather than looping) may result in only partial credit.\n",
    "- We have tried to include all the libraries you may need to do the assignment in the imports cell provided below. Please get course staff approval before importing any additional 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "- Enable scrolling output on cells with very long output. Or better yet, avoid overly long output altogether.\n",
    "- Feel free to add additional code or markdown cells as needed.\n",
    "- Don't forget to include a written response when one is requested by a question prompt.\n",
    "- Ensure your code runs top to bottom without error and passes all tests by restarting the kernel and running all cells (note that this can take a few minutes). \n",

    "- When retrieving JSON content with <code>requests</code>, us the `json()` method rather than the `text` attribute to extract the content from the returned request object into a nested dictionary rather than a string.\n",
    "- APIs often take parameters as key-value pairs occuring after a '?' character in the URL. For example 'http://archive.org/wayback/available?url=example.com&timestamp=20060101' includes a 'url' and a 'timestamp' parameter. When using <code>requests.get()</code> you can exclude these parameters from the URL itself and instead pass them as a dictionary to an argument called 'params'.\n",

This gives access to new datatypes including native strings (as opposed to the catch-all 'object'), ints that support NaN values, and others. Using these datatypes can often speed up computations so you may choose to experiment with converting some or all of your columns to these new datatypes.

    "3. There are fluctuations in the number of screenings between 1945 and 2025.\n",
    "4. The largest number of screenings occurred in 2000, 2018 and 2024 and 2025, with peaks in 2018 and 2025.\n",

    "1. Cinema activities experienced growth over time with a few dominant theaters consistently accounting for a large portion of screenings.\n",
    "2. There are more theaters screening movies in recent years than in the early years.\n",
    "3. Further studies could be conducted to understand the cause of the spikes seen in some years."

    "Use the Wikipedia Python library to find a stable identifier for each film’s Wikipedia page and store it in a new `wiki_id` column. Prefer the numeric page ID (`page.pageid`); a canonical article URL is acceptable. Display the head of your updated DataFrame and briefly describe your approach. Aim for at least 50% coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Hints:</strong>\n",
    "- Set up the library: `wikipedia.set_lang(\"en\")` and `wikipedia.set_rate_limiting(True)`.\n",
    "- Build your search query from known fields (e.g., title + year + \"film\" [+ director if helpful]).\n",
    "- Use `wikipedia.search(...)`, then fetch a page with `wikipedia.page(..., auto_suggest=True)`.\n",
    "- Extract a stable ID: `page.pageid` (preferred) or `page.url`.\n",
    "- Handle `DisambiguationError` and `PageError`; return `None` when you’re not confident.\n",

    "#### My Approach\n",
    "My approach is to create a search query with movie title, film, release year and directors. This query is used to search Wikipedia for matching pages. The topmost five pages from the search result are parse to check whether any contains the attributes in the query. A page is considered a match if it includes the movie title and at least two of the following: release year, directors, or the word film. Although this method is somewhat aggressive, it increases the likelihood that any matched page is the correct Wikipedia entry for the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, previously discovered page ids are read from disk and cached in a dictionary, allowing for faster lookups when a pageid already exist for a query. To speed up searches, a ThreadPoolExecutor with two worker threads is used to parallelize requests to Wikipedia. Before a new search is performed, the cache is checked for an existing page ID. A Wikipedia search is only executed if no cached ID is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing search results involves checking whether the movie title is present in the page title, extracting the infobox table, and verifying the presence of the release date and directors. The page title is also checked for the word film. If a page satisfies the condition of containing the movie title and any two of release year, director, or film, it is considered a match, and its page ID is returned. To minimize processing overhead, only the top five search results are examined, as these are the most likely to correspond to the movie. All comparisons are case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text below is left as is from the downloaded notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these missed pages the above approach is still suboptimal.\n",
    "The code makes aysnyc wikipedia searches of the form '\\<title> \\<director> film'. It then goes through the search result pages until it finds one in which half of its 'categories' (listed at the bottom of a Wikipedia page) are contain 'film'. It probably would have been better to check for certain fields in the infobox (the section on the top right of most wikipedia pages) rather than the looking at the categories."

This final section is very open-ended, and you are encouraged to experiment. We want to see what you can do!\n",

    "1. **Data Extraction and Integration**\n",
    "   - Extract at least one new piece of data from each movie page you found.\n",
    "   - Add this data as a new column(s) to your DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Display the head of your updated DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Discuss your strategy for extracting the new data, including any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**\n",
    "    - Formulate at least two new questions that involve the Wikipedia data you've added.\n",
    "    - For each question:\n",
    "      - Clearly state your question and why it's interesting or relevant.\n",
    "      - Describe your approach to answering the question.\n",
    "      - Use Pandas to manipulate and analyze the data as needed.\n",
    "      - Create at least one meaningful visualization that helps answer your question.\n",

    "- Feel free to extract more than just a single new piece of data to use in your analysis. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can even jump from the film page to other linked pages to acquire more data!\n",

    "#### My strategy:\n",
    "I utilize up to 8 worker threads to process the HTML content simultaneously and extract additional data from the wiki pages to enhance the initial movie information. The extra fields retrieved are Countries, Language, Budget, and Box Office — all located within the infobox table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple threads improves performance by reducing overall processing time. The BeautifulSoup library is employed to parse the HTML content, making data extraction straightforward, readable, and easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins by locating the infobox, identified via HTML table attribute and the corresponding CSS class. All the table rows are then collected into a list. The parser iterates through this list, searching for specific tokens within the text of <th> tags in each row. Once a token is found, the corresponding <td> tag's text is extracted as the attribute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling the Countries field posed some challenges. Initially, the token was set as \"country,\" but it was later observed that some movies list multiple countries and use the label \"Countries.\" Therefore, both \"country\" and \"countries\" are used as tokens. During processing, both tokens and extracted texts are normalized to lowercase to prevent mismatches caused by case differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Budget and Box Office fields contain monetary values with currency codes and descriptors like \"Million.\" Additional processing is necessary to standardize these values before further analysis."
