## Steps Involved in Creating a Model that Makes Predictions
1. Prepare The Training Data
2. Define The Model
After defining the model, you can use `model.summary()` to get information about the model.
Note: Flatten the input and pass the output through the neural networks
3. Compile The Model
4. Train The Model
5. Evaluate The Model
6. Make Predictions
